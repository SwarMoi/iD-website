I"ý<p>The speech and language processing laboratory, <strong>SPLangLab</strong>, at <a href="http://efluniversity.ac.in/">The English and Foreign Languages University</a>, Hyderabad is engaged in conducting acoustic phonetic and speech production studies on the one end and also large scale corpus level investigations of various speech phenomenon using automatic methods.</p>

<p>The general approach followed by us treats speech as a dynamic process which needs to be modeled accordingly. We study both lab-based production and we also use machine learning to learn about patterns of acoustic variation that are caused by the overlap of articulatory gestures.</p>
